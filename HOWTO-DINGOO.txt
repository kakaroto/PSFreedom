| STEPS: |
+——–+

1. Place the zImage file in your mini-SD card (important: choose the one that works with your LCD screen!!).
2. Run Dingux and wait for the kernel to boot completely.
3. Now your Dingoo behaves like the PSJailbreak device!!

| NOTES: |
+——–+

The patch for the kernel is included in the “kernel-patch” folder. The patch has been created to be
applied on the top of the opendingux 2.6.35 kernel tree.
